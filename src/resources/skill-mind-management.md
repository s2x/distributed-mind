# Mind Management Protocol

This skill is **MANDATORY** when mind MCP is available. Use it for every session — coding, research, planning, debugging, design reviews, conversations. If something is worth doing, it's worth remembering.

## Why This Exists

Without persistent memory: context dies when sessions end, future agents repeat solved mistakes, and decisions lack traceable rationale.

With mind: every agent inherits prior knowledge, decisions form a traceable graph, recovery from compaction is instant, and users never re-explain context.

---

## Session Lifecycle

### 1. RECOVER — Before anything else

```
checkpoint_query { space: "<project>" }
```

This returns available checkpoints. Then load the specific one:

```
checkpoint_load { space: "<project>", checkpointName: "<name>" }
```

If no checkpoints exist, the response tells you — proceed to step 2.

### 2. ORIENT — Understand what exists

```
space_get { name: "<project>" }
memory_query { space: "<project>", limit: 10 }
memory_query { space: "<project>", search: "<current-task-keywords>" }
```

`space_get` returns space details plus hot (T1+T2) memories preview. Use `memory_query` with `search` parameter for task-related context.

If the space doesn't exist:

```
space_create {
  name: "projects/<repo-name>",
  description: "Context and decisions for <repo-name>",
  tags: ["type:project"]
}
```

**Space naming**: Always use the actual repo/directory name. Future agents find memories by searching the repo name.

### 3. WORK — Persist as you go

Every significant action produces a memory or checkpoint update.

### 4. CLOSE — Summarize and complete

```
checkpoint_done {
  space: "<project>",
  summary: "What was accomplished in this session"
}
```

`checkpoint_done` automatically creates a session memory in `sessions/<repo>` and deletes the checkpoint. Optionally, you may enrich it with `memory_update` after if more detail is needed.

## When to Create Memories

Call `memory_add` **immediately** after:

| Event                   | Tag              |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| Decision made           | `cat:decision`   |
| Bug identified or fixed | `cat:bugfix`     |
| Non-obvious discovery   | `cat:discovery`  |
| Pattern established     | `cat:pattern`    |
| Config or env change    | `cat:config`     |
| User preference learned | `cat:preference` |

### Memory Content Format

```
memory_add {
  space: "projects/mind",
  name: "MCP tool descriptions redesign",
  content: "**What**: Rewrote all MCP tool descriptions.\n**Why**: Agents weren't using link features.\n**Where**: cli/src/mcp/tools/\n**Learned**: Examples work better than rules.",
  tags: ["cat:decision", "cat:discovery"],
  links_to: ["<name-of-related-memory>"]
}
```

**Name format**: descriptive, kebab-case — `auth-jwt-token-expiry`, `mcp-tool-descriptions-redesign`

---

## Linking Memories

Links turn isolated notes into a knowledge graph. **Always link when a relationship exists.**

### When to Link

| Situation                              | Label         |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Bugfix caused by a prior decision      | `caused_by`   |
| Discovery that updates a pattern       | `extends`     |
| New decision that overrides an old one | `contradicts` |
| Implementation of a design decision    | `implements`  |
| Two memories about the same subsystem  | `relates_to`  |

### How to Link

**At creation time** (preferred):

```
memory_add {
  space: "projects/mind",
  name: "auth-jwt-mobile-expiry-fix",
  content: "Fixed JWT early expiry on mobile...",
  tags: ["cat:bugfix"],
  links_to: ["auth-jwt-decision", "mobile-clock-skew-discovery"]
}
```

**Between existing memories** (discovered later):

```
link_create {
  sourceRef: "projects/mind:auth-jwt-mobile-expiry-fix",
  targetRef: "projects/mind:auth-jwt-decision",
  label: "caused_by"
}
```

References use `space:name` format. Bare names work for same-space memories.

**Important**: `links_to` is best-effort. Always check `links_failed` in the response.

## Checkpoint Discipline

Checkpoints survive context resets and compaction. Be disciplined about them.

### When to Save

| Event                       | What to save             |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| User approves a plan        | `goal` + `pending` steps |
| Complete a subtask          | Update `pending`         |
| Significant decision made   | Add to `notes`           |
| Before a risky operation    | Full state snapshot      |
| Every 15-20 minutes of work | Progress update          |

```
checkpoint_save {
  space: "projects/mind",
  goal: "Redesign MCP tool descriptions",
  pending: "Update system instructions, Regenerate test snapshots",
  notes: "User wants links more prominent.",
  linked_memories: ["mcp-descriptions-decision"]
}
```

`linked_memories` links memories to the checkpoint — when `checkpoint_load` is called, these memories are returned in enriched memory_read format.

### Checkpoint Aging

- **< 30 minutes**: Continue using the current checkpoint
- **≥ 30 minutes**: Close it with `checkpoint_done` and create a new one with `checkpoint_save`

### When to Complete

```
checkpoint_done {
  space: "projects/mind",
  summary: "Redesigned all MCP descriptions. Tests passing."
}
```

`checkpoint_done` transforms the checkpoint into a session memory in `sessions/<repo>` and deletes the checkpoint.

## Tier System

| Tier | Name | Purpose                  | Limit per space |
| ---- | ---- | ------------------------ | --------------- |
| T1   | hot  | Critical active context  | 25              |
| T2   | warm | Default for new memories | 50              |
| T3   | cold | Reference, past patterns | unlimited       |

**Behaviors:**

- New memories start at T2 unless you specify otherwise
- `memory_read` auto-promotes one tier up
- When a tier is full, least-recently-used non-pinned memory is evicted down
- `pinned` memories are immune to promotion and eviction

## Tool Quick Reference

| Tool                  | Purpose                                                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `space_create`        | Create space (required before adding memories). Tags required.                        |

| `checkpoint_save`     | Save/update session state (goal, pending, notes)                                      |
| `checkpoint_load`     | Restore a specific checkpoint by name (use checkpoint_query first)                    |
| `checkpoint_done`     | Transform checkpoint to session memory in `sessions/<repo>` and delete the checkpoint |
| `checkpoint_query`    | Query checkpoints with filters: status, date range, tag, limit/offset                 |
| `system_instructions` | Get full protocol documentation                                                       |

## Enforcement Checklist

1. **Session start** → `checkpoint_query` then `checkpoint_load` with specific name before any work
2. **Plan approved** → `checkpoint_save` immediately
3. **Significant event** → `memory_add` with tags NOW
4. **Related memory exists** → Link via `links_to` or `link_create`
5. **Subtask done** → Update checkpoint with `checkpoint_save`
6. **Session end** → `checkpoint_done` + session summary memory

### Anti-Patterns

| Don't                              | Do                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Add memories without tags          | Every memory needs at least one tag                                    |
| Skip linking related memories      | Use `links_to` or `link_create`                                        |
| Let checkpoints go stale           | Update `checkpoint_save` after subtasks                                |
| Skip session recovery              | Always `checkpoint_query` + `checkpoint_load` with specific name first |
| Hoard everything in T1/T2          | Move old memories to T3                                                |
| Create memories for obvious things | Only memory non-obvious, valuable knowledge                            |

### You're breaking the rules if:

- You've done significant work without a single `memory_add`
- You created a memory without tags
- You created a memory that relates to an existing one but didn't link it
- Your checkpoint is stale (goal/pending doesn't match current state)
- The user asks "what were we working on" and you can't answer
- You reimplement something a prior session already figured out

If any of these apply: **stop and fix it before continuing.**
